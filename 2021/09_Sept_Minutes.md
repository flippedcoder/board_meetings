	- Alcohol will only be paid for/provided by Techlahoma at Techlahoma board organized events.User groups may have alcohol at events, but 1) alcohol may not be purchased with Techlahoma funds, 2) a sponsor can be used to pay for alcohol, 3) all meetups with alcohol must be held at locations licensed to serve alcohol with a licensed bartender, such as a brewery or coffee/wine bar, 4) all rules and regulations in accordance with local, state, and federal laws must be followed.

- Guide to handling employment in OK
	- If a company has 0 employees in Oklahoma (fully remote company etc) they have to set up payroll in Oklahoma to hire a remote Oklahoma employee 
	- Got a quote - sounds like a good idea to set up a packet to help organizations with doing that 

- Retreat Update
	- User Groups Update
		- Getting survey together 
		- Maxx & Luke - going to combine two groups in Tulsa for now - increases break out rooms & allows them to do the same day/time as OKC group and do it in the same meet up. Location has cameras & can stream 5+ groups at the same time. 
		- Idea; reaching out to a Francis Tuttle; university to see what can be done in OKC as well

## New Business
