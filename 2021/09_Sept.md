## Unfinished Business

- Alcohol Policy Update 
	- Alcohol will only be paid for/provided by Techlahoma at Techlahoma board organized events.
	User groups may have alcohol at events, but 1) alcohol may not be purchased with Techlahoma funds, 2) a sponsor should be used to pay for alcohol, 3) no minors are allowed to 
 drink, 4) meetups with alcohol must be held at locations with a licensed bartender, such as a brewery or coffee/wine bar.
